  - question: What camera is best for wedding photography?
    answer: For professional wedding photography, a full-frame camera with good low-light performance is essential. Popular choices include the Canon EOS R6, Sony A7 IV, or Nikon Z6 II. These cameras offer excellent autofocus, dual card slots for backup, and superior image quality in various lighting conditions.
  - question: Do I need a backup camera for weddings?
    answer: Yes, having a backup camera is absolutely essential for wedding photography. Equipment can fail at any moment, and you can't ask the couple to pause their wedding for technical issues. Always carry at least two professional camera bodies to ensure you never miss crucial moments.
  - question: What lenses should I bring to a wedding?
    answer: A typical professional wedding kit should include a 24-70mm f/2.8 for versatility, a 70-200mm f/2.8 for ceremonies and candids, and a fast prime lens like a 50mm f/1.4 or 85mm f/1.4 for portraits and low-light situations. Having backup lenses is also recommended.
  - question: Is a flash necessary for wedding photography?
    answer: Yes, a good flash system is crucial for wedding photography. While natural light is beautiful, many wedding venues have challenging lighting conditions, especially during receptions. Bring multiple speedlights, light modifiers, and backup batteries to ensure consistent quality throughout the event.
